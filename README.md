##  Week 2
### Previous Work Research
> Eddie Yang and Margaret Roberts from University of California, San Diego published on 22.Jan.2021 the atricle "Censorship of online Encyclopedia", which discusses the differences of training a NLP model on 2 online encyclopedia: Wikipedia and its Chinese equivalent, Baidu Baike. The researchers found proof of what they initially believed, that censorship influences the classification of words based on their political meaning: for example 'democracy' is more related to 'chaos' then it is to 'stability'. Finally, a news headline analyzer built on top of this had a bias in siding with propaganda ideas and against non-patriots.
